        <h3>Focus Clock Narrative</h3>
        <p><strong>Context:</strong> This sketch represents a “focus clock” designed to help users visualize their concentration time in an engaging and calming way. It supports students or remote workers who want to manage study sessions effectively.</p>
        <p><strong>Design decisions:</strong> I used a circular layout to symbolize continuous time. The color gradually shifts from bright green to orange to show progress. Minimal text and gentle animations maintain focus and calmness.</p>
        <p><strong>Future work:</strong> I plan to add features like automatic break reminders, haptic feedback, and customizable color themes.</p>

        <h3>Tree Growth Clock Narrative</h3>
        <p><strong>Context:</strong> This sketch visualizes time through tree growth. Each hour helps the tree grow taller, turning time tracking into something organic and rewarding.</p>
        <p><strong>Who is this for?</strong> Designed for students or anyone practicing mindful productivity who prefers a nature-inspired metaphor.</p>
        <p><strong>Design decisions:</strong> Vertical layout mimics growth, with basic colors — green leaves, brown trunk, light background. Every hour restarts growth, symbolizing renewal.</p>
        <p><strong>Future work:</strong> Add seasonal changes and data tracking to build a personal “forest” of focus sessions.</p>

        <h3>Notebook Clock Narrative</h3>
        <p><strong>Context:</strong> This clock flips notebook pages as focus time passes, turning time into a visible record of effort and progress.</p>
        <p><strong>Who is this for?</strong> Students, writers, or anyone who enjoys journaling or studying. The notebook metaphor connects time management with personal reflection.</p>
        <p><strong>Design decisions:</strong> Horizontal layout mimics an open notebook. Beige and brown tones create warmth and familiarity. Lines fill gradually to represent progress calmly and clearly.</p>
        <p><strong>Future work:</strong> Add page-flipping animations and interactive notes to turn the clock into a digital journal.</p>

        <h3>Fuel vs Burn: Are Your Meals Helping or Hurting?</h3>
        <p><strong>Dataset:</strong>
          This visualization uses data from
          <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jockeroika/life-style-data/data" target="_blank">
            Life Style Data (Kaggle)</a>,
          which contains information on individuals’ diet types, daily calorie intake, activity levels, and health indicators
          such as BMI and weight changes.
        </p>
        
        <p><strong>Why this dataset:</strong>
          I chose this dataset because it directly connects to the theme of “Fuel vs Burn.” It provides measurable variables
          like calories consumed, calories burned, and diet type — perfect for comparing energy balance across different eating
          habits.
          The dataset also represents relatable, real-world behaviors that people can personally connect with, making the
          narrative both informative and self-reflective.
          Using this data allows the visualization to ground the metaphor (plates balancing intake and burn) in actual evidence
          rather than abstract examples, ensuring both clarity and credibility.
        </p>


        <p><strong>Context:</strong> This narrative visualization explores how different diet types balance calorie intake (“fuel”) and calorie burn (“burn”) using an intuitive metaphor — a set of plates. Each plate represents one diet type, comparing average calories consumed versus calories burned.</p>

        <p><strong>Why this story:</strong> People often track calories, but raw numbers feel abstract. This metaphor turns energy balance into a tangible visual — like a plate that tips toward health or excess. The question “Are your meals helping or hurting?” encourages reflection without blame.</p>

        <p><strong>User-driven vs Author-driven:</strong> This visualization is mainly <em>author-driven</em> because it presents a clear message comparing diets and calorie balance. However, it also includes <em>user-driven</em> aspects by allowing viewers to compare and interpret which diets seem balanced or excessive. This aligns with lecture content about balancing narrative control with user exploration.</p>

        <p><strong>Design decisions:</strong> I used a <em>balancing plate metaphor</em> for clarity and hierarchy. Red shows calories consumed, blue shows calories burned, and plate height indicates energy surplus or balance. The static format avoids distraction, emphasizing contrast and simplicity.</p>

        <p><strong>Hierarchy and clarity:</strong> Visual hierarchy guides attention:
        <ol>
          <li><b>Title</b> — frames the question and sets tone.</li>
          <li><b>Plates</b> — encode key comparison (intake vs burn).</li>
          <li><b>Caption & legend</b> — ensure correct interpretation.</li>
        </ol>
        Every element is purposeful, enhancing clarity and memorability.</p>

        <p><strong>Feedback and refinement:</strong> Early sketches used a tree metaphor, but peers said it lacked clear data and meal connection. I refined it into a “plate” visualization for stronger narrative alignment and immediate recognition. The simpler metaphor improved clarity and comparison.</p>

        <p><strong>User interviews:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Aurora:</b> Understood the tree as calorie balance but wanted visible data labels and color distinction. → Added numeric calorie labels and consistent red/blue colors for clarity.</li>
          <li><b>Ella:</b> Found the tree metaphor confusing for a food story. → Inspired the shift to plates, aligning visuals with the “meal” concept and improving memorability.</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Design principles applied:</strong> The design emphasizes <b>clarity</b> (minimal marks, clear labels), <b>hierarchy</b> (title → plate → caption), and <b>memorability</b> (concrete metaphor). It follows ethical visualization practices by presenting balanced comparisons without exaggeration.</p>
