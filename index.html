          <p>
            <strong>Context:</strong> This sketch represents a “focus clock” designed to help users visualize their
            concentration time in an engaging and calming way. It aims to support students or remote workers who want to
            manage their study or work sessions effectively without distractions.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Design decisions:</strong> I used a circular layout to symbolize the continuous flow of time and
            progress. The color gradually shifts from bright green to warm orange as time passes, signaling both
            calmness and accomplishment. Minimal text and gentle animations keep the interface simple and
            focus-friendly. I chose these elements to reduce cognitive load and maintain user attention.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Future work:</strong> I plan to add features like automatic break reminders, sound or haptic
            feedback for session transitions, and customizable color themes to match different moods or time of day.

          <h3 id="sk2-narrative-title">Tree Growth Clock Narrative</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Context:</strong> This sketch visualizes the passing of time through the gradual growth of a tree.
            Each minute or hour of focus time helps the tree grow taller or sprout new leaves, turning the act of time
            tracking into something more organic and rewarding.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Who is this for?</strong> It’s designed for students or anyone practicing mindful productivity who
            wants a calm, nature-inspired alternative to traditional timers. The visual metaphor of growth encourages
            users to stay focused and see their effort “grow” over time.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Design decisions:</strong> I used a vertical layout to mimic natural tree growth, with simple
            animations showing leaves appearing as time progresses. The colors are kept basic — green for leaves, brown
            for the trunk, and a light background — to keep the focus on the growth itself. Each new hour triggers the
            tree to restart its growth cycle, symbolizing a fresh beginning and helping users visualize the passage of
            time more clearly.
          <p>
            <strong>Future work:</strong> In the future, I’d like to add seasonal changes (like flowers or falling
            leaves) and data tracking so users can see how their “forest” grows across multiple focus sessions.

          <p>
            <strong>Context:</strong> This sketch visualizes time through a notebook that flips pages as focus time
            passes. Each page turn represents progress, encouraging users to view their time as meaningful work
            completed rather than just minutes spent.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Who is this for?</strong> It’s designed for students, writers, or anyone who enjoys journaling or
            studying. The notebook metaphor connects the idea of learning and time management, making the experience
            more personal and relatable.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Design decisions:</strong> I used a horizontal layout to mimic an open notebook, with soft beige and
            brown tones to create a warm and familiar atmosphere. Instead of page-flipping, the notebook fills gradually
            with subtle marks or lines as time passes, representing progress in a calm, visual way. I kept the layout
            simple and uncluttered to maintain focus and reduce distraction.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Future work:</strong> I plan to add a page-flipping animation so that each time segment turns a new
            page, giving a stronger sense of progress. I’d also like to include interactive notes or doodles on each
            page to reflect different sessions and maybe add a daily summary — turning the clock into both a time
            tracker and a digital journal.

            <strong>Step 1 —</strong> Initial idea of a notebook page filling with lines as time passes.
            Each new line represents a short time segment, showing progress in a subtle and calm way.

            <em>Peer comment:</em> “I like how it feels like actual handwriting — it gives a sense of studying quietly.
            Maybe add some visible headings to make it feel more like a real notebook.”

            <strong>Step 2 —</strong> Added headings and light structure, such as “Chapter 1: Intro to Data,” to make
            each page look more personalized.
            <em>Peer comment:</em> “The added text makes it more relatable to students. It’d be cool if the text or page
            updated automatically every hour to show a new ‘chapter.’”

            This mimics the feeling of writing notes in real time, connecting time tracking with focus and journaling.
            <em>Peer comment:</em> “The typing effect makes it feel alive — like the notebook is documenting your study
            session for you. It fits the calm, reflective theme really well.”

          <h3 id="sk5-narrative-title">Fuel vs Burn: Are Your Meals Helping or Hurting?</h3>

          <p>
            <strong>Context:</strong> This narrative visualization explores how different diet types balance calorie
            intake (“fuel”) and calorie burn (“burn”) using an intuitive metaphor — a set of plates. The project aims to
            help fitness enthusiasts and everyday users quickly grasp which diets maintain balance and which lean toward
            excess. Each plate represents one diet type, comparing average calories consumed versus calories burned.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Why this story:</strong> Many people track calories, but raw numbers can feel abstract. I wanted to
            make energy balance feel tangible — as if each diet were a “plate” trying to stay level. The idea invites
            the audience to think about daily habits as a visual balance between nourishment and activity, not just data
            points. The question, “Are your meals helping or hurting?” encourages reflection rather than judgment.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Design decisions:</strong> I chose a <em>static balancing plate metaphor</em> for clarity and
            hierarchy. The viewer first notices the title and contrasting red/blue colors, then compares how high or low
            each plate sits. Red represents calories consumed, blue represents calories burned, and plate height shows
            the degree of energy surplus or balance. Motion was intentionally removed to improve clarity, leaving a
            clean and stable composition. Shadows and subtle scaling emphasize differences without distorting the data.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Hierarchy and clarity:</strong> Visual hierarchy directs attention in three stages:
          <ol>
            <li><b>Title</b> — frames the question (“Fuel vs Burn”) and establishes the story.</li>
            <li><b>Plates</b> — serve as the central metaphor; height and color communicate the main insight.</li>
            <li><b>Caption and legend</b> — clarify interpretation and ensure transparency about what each color and
              position means.</li>
          </ol>
          Every element supports comprehension — no decorative marks were included. The caption explicitly explains the
          visual encoding so the audience can read it ethically and confidently.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Feedback and refinement:</strong> Early peer feedback noted that the previous tree design was
            unclear and the animated tilt felt distracting. I refined the visualization by switching to a stable,
            metaphorical plate that immediately communicates balance and imbalance. The static layout made differences
            more noticeable and supported easier comparison between diet types.
          </p>

          <p>
            <strong>Design principles applied:</strong> The final composition reflects hierarchy (through scale and
            layout), clarity (through minimal marks and consistent color encoding), and memorability (through a concrete
            metaphor). The design follows ethical visualization practices by avoiding misleading axes or exaggeration,
            while still emphasizing meaningful differences.
