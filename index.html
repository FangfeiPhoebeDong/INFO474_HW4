          <p>
            <strong>Context:</strong> This sketch represents a “focus clock” designed to help users visualize their concentration time in an engaging and calming way. It aims to support students or remote workers who want to manage their study or work sessions effectively without distractions.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Design decisions:</strong> I used a circular layout to symbolize the continuous flow of time and progress. The color gradually shifts from bright green to warm orange as time passes, signaling both calmness and accomplishment. Minimal text and gentle animations keep the interface simple and focus-friendly. I chose these elements to reduce cognitive load and maintain user attention.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Future work:</strong> I plan to add features like automatic break reminders, sound or haptic feedback for session transitions, and customizable color themes to match different moods or time of day.

          <h3 id="sk2-narrative-title">Tree Growth Clock Narrative</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Context:</strong> This sketch visualizes the passing of time through the gradual growth of a tree. Each minute or hour of focus time helps the tree grow taller or sprout new leaves, turning the act of time tracking into something more organic and rewarding.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Who is this for?</strong> It’s designed for students or anyone practicing mindful productivity who wants a calm, nature-inspired alternative to traditional timers. The visual metaphor of growth encourages users to stay focused and see their effort “grow” over time.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Design decisions:</strong> I used a vertical layout to mimic natural tree growth, with simple animations showing leaves appearing as time progresses. The colors are kept basic — green for leaves, brown for the trunk, and a light background — to keep the focus on the growth itself. Each new hour triggers the tree to restart its growth cycle, symbolizing a fresh beginning and helping users visualize the passage of time more clearly.
          <p>
            <strong>Future work:</strong> In the future, I’d like to add seasonal changes (like flowers or falling leaves) and data tracking so users can see how their “forest” grows across multiple focus sessions.

          <h3 id="sk3-narrative-title">Notebook Clock Narrative</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>Context:</strong> This sketch visualizes time through a notebook that flips pages as focus time passes. Each page turn represents progress, encouraging users to view their time as meaningful work completed rather than just minutes spent.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Who is this for?</strong> It’s designed for students, writers, or anyone who enjoys journaling or studying. The notebook metaphor connects the idea of learning and time management, making the experience more personal and relatable.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Design decisions:</strong> I used a horizontal layout to mimic an open notebook, with soft beige and brown tones to create a warm and familiar atmosphere. Instead of page-flipping, the notebook fills gradually with subtle marks or lines as time passes, representing progress in a calm, visual way. I kept the layout simple and uncluttered to maintain focus and reduce distraction.
          </p>
          <p>
            <strong>Future work:</strong> I plan to add a page-flipping animation so that each time segment turns a new page, giving a stronger sense of progress. I’d also like to include interactive notes or doodles on each page to reflect different sessions and maybe add a daily summary — turning the clock into both a time tracker and a digital journal.

            <strong>Step 1 —</strong> Initial idea of a notebook page filling with lines as time passes.
            Each new line represents a short time segment, showing progress in a subtle and calm way.  
            
            <em>Peer comment:</em> “I like how it feels like actual handwriting — it gives a sense of studying quietly. Maybe add some visible headings to make it feel more like a real notebook.”

            <strong>Step 2 —</strong> Added headings and light structure, such as “Chapter 1: Intro to Data,” to make each page look more personalized.  
            <em>Peer comment:</em> “The added text makes it more relatable to students. It’d be cool if the text or page updated automatically every hour to show a new ‘chapter.’”

            <strong>Step 3 —</strong> Final version titled <em>Time Notebook</em>, featuring a typing-like interaction where lines appear gradually as time progresses.
            This mimics the feeling of writing notes in real time, connecting time tracking with focus and journaling.  
            <em>Peer comment:</em> “The typing effect makes it feel alive — like the notebook is documenting your study session for you. It fits the calm, reflective theme really well.”
